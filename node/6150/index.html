    <div class="field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden"><div class="field-items"><div class="field-item even"><p>From  April through October 2008, the Illinois Natural History Survey (INHS) and the  University of Illinois (U of I) conducted tournament research in coordination  with the Ever-Bloom tournament trail at Evergreen and Lakes. The goals of this study were to 1) evaluate delayed mortality (fish that  are weighed-in alive but die within 3 days of the tournament) after bass  tournaments at Evergreen Lake and 2) evaluate the physiological status (stress)  of tournament-caught bass at Lake Bloomington at a seasonal scale. Little  attention has been paid to smaller, club-style tournaments (&lt;50 boats)  although they are more frequent and localized than larger, tour-style events.  Results from this study will not only provide a clear picture of what is going  on at tournaments at Evergreen and Bloomington lakes, but will also provide  recommendations to tournament organizations throughout the state and country to  improve tournament practices and minimize the impact of tournaments on  fisheries.</p>
<p>Research Methods</p>
<ul><li>Visited tournaments at Evergreen and Bloomington Lakes in 2008, one  tournament per lake per season (seasons defined as early-spring,  late-spring/early-summer, mid-summer, fall)</li>
<li>Performed delayed mortality estimates at Evergreen Lake using holding  pens<br /><ul type="none"><li>Placed tournament-caught fish into holding pens following the conclusion  of the tournaments</li>
<li>Checked for delayed mortality for 3 days, then released remaining  fish</li>
<li> 3 days is a standard length of time used in other  studies—if kept for more than 3 days, any mortality of bass is probably not due  to the tournament</li>
<li>Used  9 feet deep soft mesh cages to allow the fish to choose from a variety of  depths/temperatures and minimizing the effects of the holding pens</li>
<li>Collected control fish using electrofishing gear to account for  cage-induced mortality</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Evaluated physiological condition (stress) at Lake Bloomington<br /><ul type="none"><li>Took  blood from tournament-caught bass following the conclusion of the  tournament</li>
<li>Some  whole blood was stored in liquid nitrogen while the remainder was separated into  plasma and red blood cells which was then frozen in liquid nitrogen</li>
<li>Analyzed blood and plasma samples at our lab in Urbana for stress indicators</li>
<li>Also  collected blood from a "resting" control group of fish to determine seasonal  baselines of blood parameters</li>
</ul></li>
</ul><p> Results</p>
<p> </p>
<ul><li>Evergreen Lake<br /><ul type="none"><li>No  delayed mortality during early-spring, late-spring or summer tournaments</li>
<li>1  delayed mortality during fall</li>
<li>Water  temperature was as high as 82ºF during the summer</li>
<li>All  tournaments combined, there was a total of 1% delayed mortality</li>
<li>5%  delayed mortality is considered the standard for "very good" so Ever-Bloom  tournaments were even better</li>
<li>Overall, Ever-Bloom tournaments had very minimal impact with respect to  mortality at Evergreen Lake</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Lake  Bloomington<br /><ul type="none"><li>Blood/plasma parameters indicated that summer was most stressful followed  by late-spring, early-spring, then fall</li>
<li>Fall  fish exhibited very few changes in stress parameters, indicating fish caught in  the fall were only slightly affected by tournaments</li>
<li>Summer fish (both resting and tournament-caught) had low levels of  hemoglobin which carries oxygen in the blood (similar to humans). This suggests  that bass simply don't carry as much oxygen in their blood during the  summer</li>
<li>Late-spring fish showed changes in stress parameters even though water  temperatures were relatively cool. This is possibly due to stress or recovery  from spawning.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul><p>Summary</p>
<p>Although we saw increased stress parameters during tournaments, we did  not observe any significant mortality even though water temperatures were  upwards of 82ºF during summer.  This is most likely due to the  extremely efficient weigh-in procedure during all tournaments. From previous  studies, the weigh-in has been identified as the most stressful part of a  tournament for bass but the weigh-ins conducted by the Ever-Bloom circuit were  quick and efficient. Some notable practices that reduced stress in  bass:</p>
<ul><li>Boats  were trailered before weigh-ins<br /><ul type="none"><li>This  meant that fish spent minimal time in weigh-in bags. Fish only had to spend a  small amount of time in weigh-in bags as anglers got their catch from their  nearby boats rather than docking boats, putting fish in bags, carrying them to  the scale, and then waiting for others to weigh-in.</li>
<li>Livewells are comfortable environments for bass as they are aerated,  shaded, and temperatures do not fluctuate severely </li>
<li>Weigh-in bags are uncomfortable for bass as they are un-aerated, exposed  to the sun, and have less water than livewells so temperatures can change more  quickly and more drastically</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Only  a few weigh-in bags were allowed out at a time<br /><ul type="none"><li>If  many weigh-in bags are allowed out at a time, then fish spend a lot of time in  them as anglers wait for others to weigh-in </li>
<li>A lot  of times, if there are anglers waiting, they usually rest their weigh-in bags on  the hot asphalt/concrete which can be bad for bass</li>
<li>Some  organizations like to distribute a lot of weigh-in bags because they think that  it will speed up the weigh-in process. At the Ever-Bloom tournaments, even  though there were only a few bags let out at a time, weigh-ins were continuous  and quick.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>1-pound dead fish penalty<br /><ul type="none"><li>This  is about 4 times higher than the standard dead fish penalty</li>
<li>This  penalty definitely made sure anglers were conscientious  of the  health of their fish</li>
<li>Anglers ensuring aerators worked and making sure aerators were run during  tournaments to avoid such a large penalty definitely reduced the stress and  mortality of the fish</li>
</ul></li>
</ul><p>Conclusion/Suggestions/Recommendations</p>
<ul type="none"><li>This  study showed that when run properly, tournaments can have a minimal impact on  the fishery</li>
<li>The  Ever-Bloom circuit did several things right and provides a good example for  other organizations to learn from</li>
<li>I  only have 3 suggestions for the circuit to further minimize stress of  bass:<br /><ul type="none"><li>Consider using aerated weigh-in bags, especially during summer<br /><ul type="none"><li>Fish  carry less oxygen during summer, warmer water holds less oxygen, and weigh-in  bags can heat up quickly because there is not much water</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Consider conducting weigh-ins in a shaded area to further reduce the  temperature changes fish can experience</li>
<li>Keep  doing what you're doing! These 2 suggestions are only suggestions—the circuit  has shown that mortality is almost negligible using their procedures</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Things learned from this study for other organizations to consider<br /><ul type="none"><li>Trailer boats before weigh-ins</li>
<li>Only  allow a few weigh-in bags out at a time to minimize the time fish spend in  them</li>
<li>Consider using large penalties for dead fish – this makes anglers double  check their fish</li>
<li>Fish  carry less oxygen in summer so be extra careful to aerate during summer</li>
<li>Consider using aerated weigh-in bags</li>
<li>Consider performing weigh-ins in the shade</li>
<li>Tournaments can have little to no mortality if run correctly and  efficiently as shown by the Ever-Bloom Circuit</li>
</ul></li>
<li>General comments for everyone<br /><ul type="none"><li>We  saw increased stress levels in late-spring even though temperatures were low.  Fish spend a lot of energy spawning and may not have fully recovered so take  extra care of these fish.</li>
<li>Run  aerators continuously, even if you have 1 small keeper in the livewell or a 25  pound limit</li>
<li>Be  careful of temperature changes in livewells—you can cold shock fish by adding  too much ice</li>
</ul></li>
</ul><p> Thanks  to all tournament participants and especially Terry Brown and Mike Blake for  allowing us to conduct this study! We've learned a lot from this study and  hopefully can apply these finding to tournaments throughout the country to  minimize the impacts of tournaments everywhere.</p>
